<!--				<h2>ALBUM LYRICS</h2>-->
				Cloud<br>
				<br>
				I look for things on a higher shelf<br>
				I look for sounds nobody is singing<br>
				I spent some money on time itself<br>
				And isn’t there a song where everybody’s singing?<br>
				<br>
				Well there’s things that talk like a piece of me<br>
				And I don’t even care about the wrong conversation<br>
				I can’t keep quiet and I can’t see shit<br>
				And there’s no point in trying when nobody will listen<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				Curves<br>
				<br>
				Catch me staring<br>
				Flinch fast, send a signal, wave back<br>
				Are you clueless?<br>
				Do you even know that I'm terrified?<br>
				<br>
				I changed my life<br>
				For a start<br>
				Why don't you want<br>
				Me in your heart<br>
				<br>
				I move slowly<br>
				It's a panic, trying to fit your mind in<br>
				Are you still there?<br>
				I'm sorry if I'm spread out paper thin<br>
				<br>
				I changed my life<br>
				For a start<br>
				Why don't you want<br>
				Me in your heart<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				Blue Jay<br>
				<br>
				Blue jay, find me<br>
				Hanging on the tree branches with ease<br>
				All day, carefree<br>
				I love it when the sun comes out to greet me<br>
				<br>
				There's only one task I attend to<br>
				Things all the birdies like me do<br>
				I hope it goes smoother than yesterday<br>
				Of course it's not guaranteed<br>
				<br>
				Duck, dodge, moving, weaving around<br>
				Let's get this awful process done<br>
				Wouldn't pick the streets to march on<br>
				I just wanna go home<br>
				<br>
				Blue jay, find me<br>
				Building up a nest in my big tree<br>
				All day, working<br>
				I can't wait for the satisfying ending<br>
				<br>
				There's only one task I attend to<br>
				Things that all birdies like me do<br>
				I hope it goes smoother than yesterday<br>
				Of course it's never guaranteed<br>
				<br>
				Duck, dodge, moving, weaving around<br>
				Let's get this awful process done<br>
				Wouldn't pick the streets to march on<br>
				I just wanna go home<br>
				<br>
				Blue jay, find me<br>
				Hanging on the tree branches with ease<br>
				All day, carefree<br>
				I wonder what today will bring<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				Away<br>
				<br>
				Living in the city<br>
				We start to get along<br>
				Keeping my wisdom<br>
				To my self again<br>
				<br>
				It takes ten steps to get to my bedroom<br>
				My door is used to getting knocked onto<br>
				<br>
				We all fall away, away, away<br>
				We're ordinary people, we're ordinary<br>
				<br>
				Taking forever<br>
				Moves I decide<br>
				Keeping my distance<br>
				While I lose taste<br>
				<br>
				It makes the hair behind my neck stand straight<br>
				It's time I take back our only fate<br>
				<br>
				We all fall away, away, away<br>
				We're ordinary people, we're ordinary<br>
				And we all fall away, away, away<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				The Island<br>
				<br>
				And the night was<br>
				Winning patience<br>
				Thoughts surrounding<br>
				Humiliation<br>
				<br>
				Do you see me<br>
				Arriving slowly?<br>
				When the sun sets<br>
				In conversations<br>
				<br>
				Oh my baby<br>
				I’m not sorry<br>
				When you find me<br>
				On the island<br>
				<br>
				Feel my body<br>
				My only body<br>
				Talk me sweetly<br>
				Don’t tell me sorry<br>
				<br>
				Oh you made me<br>
				A living fallacy<br>
				Your deception<br>
				Your own fantasy<br>
				<br>
				Oh my baby<br>
				I’m not sorry<br>
				When you find me<br>
				On the island<br>
				<br>
				And I thought you would distract me from a lie<br>
				You said your grace then hypnotized my troubled mind<br>
				<br>
				Forget about it I don’t want to live my life<br>
				Mistaking you for someone that would give me time<br>
				<br>
				Tonight whatever else makes me feel alive<br>
				Oh my your cigarette makes me alright<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				Duster<br>
				<br>
				Your walls are back to off-white<br>
				The closet is cleared out<br>
				Plane-bound in the A.M.<br>
				A discount one-way<br>
				<br>
				And you say it's all you want and more<br>
				It's all you need, it's all you want<br>
				And you say it's all you want and more<br>
				It's all you need<br>
				<br>
				It's about time you ran<br>
				As far as you could<br>
				Don't wait for me<br>
				You know that in time<br>
				I'll find my way around<br>
				<br>
				If I fall<br>
				Will you pick me up<br>
				Will you hold me in<br>
				Until I'm full<br>
				And if I ride<br>
				Will you wait for me<br>
				Will you make me see<br>
				Where I went wrong<br>
				<br>
				And you say it's all you want and more<br>
				It's all you need, it's all you want<br>
				And you say it's all you want and more<br>
				It's all you need<br>
				<br>
				It's about time you ran<br>
				As far as you could<br>
				Don't wait for me<br>
				You know that in time<br>
				I'll find my way around<br>
				<br>
				Your walls are back to off-white<br>
				The closet is cleared out<br>
				You'll never ever regret<br>
				A discount one-way<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				VEMM<br>
				<br>
				And the color of your feet<br>
				As you're moving through the west coast<br>
				When you're lost in the next chapter<br>
				Turn the pages through the highway<br>
				<br>
				It's just a matter of time<br>
				Time takes you onward<br>
				Why don't you take a picture<br>
				You'll make a new world<br>
				When it feels like nothing's right<br>
				Leaving what was meant to rot<br>
				Away<br>
				<br>
				When you want to paint a picture<br>
				Spread your colors on the table<br>
				When it's hard to have perspective <br>
				What a complex architecture<br>
				<br>
				It's just a matter of time<br>
				Time takes you onward<br>
				Why don't you take a picture<br>
				You'll make a new world<br>
				When it feels like nothing's right<br>
				Leaving what was meant to rot<br>
				Away<br>
